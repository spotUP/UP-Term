vtcon - a console window for AmigaOS 3.x (68020+)
================================================

XCON: is a console window like CON:, with a modern terminal inside:

  - xterm dialect (default): what Unix ports expect - colours (16, 256,
    RGB), scroll regions, alternate screen, mouse, bracketed paste.
    ixemul programs run with TERM=vtcon (less, nano, BitchX ...).
  - Amiga dialect (option AMIGA): the ROM console.device sequences.
    Amiga programs also work in the xterm dialect: the 8-bit CSI ($9B)
    they send keeps its Amiga meaning there.
  - PC-ANSI dialect (option PCANSI): ANSI.SYS / BBS art, CP437.

INSTALL
  Unpack, cd into the drawer, then:   Execute Install
  (copies L:vtcon-handler, DEVS:DOSDrivers/XCON, the terminfo entry to
  ENVARC:terminfo and mounts XCON:)

USE
  NewShell "XCON:0/20/640/300/My Shell/CLOSE"

  Options after the title, one per /: CLOSE WAIT BACKDROP NODRAG NOBORDER
  NOSIZE NODEPTH INACTIVE  SCREEN name  FONT name size
  DARK (light grey on black)  FG rrggbb  BG rrggbb (default colours, hex)
  XTERM AMIGA PCANSI (dialect)  LATIN1 or CP437 (xterm byte set; default
  UTF-8)

  For ixemul programs:   SetEnv TERM vtcon
                         SetEnv TERMINFO /ENVARC/terminfo
  Programs with their own termcap reader (tcsh, for one) also need
                         SetEnv TERMCAP /ENVARC/termcap.vtcon
  (they do not look in /etc/termcap by themselves; or add the vtcon entry
  to your ixemul termcap and point TERMCAP at that)
